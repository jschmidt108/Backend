# Cautious Ape - Backend

## App Production & Deployment Timeline - June 6th, 2022

##  Collaborators: Tricia Gray & Jacqueline Schmidt

##  App Background: 

Programmed and deployed a full-stack application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) NFT’s from their watchlist. 

We leveraged a 3rd party API to bring in ETH and SOL prices - the main crypto currencies in which NFT’s are bought and sold. We also implemented a crypto calculator for users to convert prices in USD to either ETH or SOL depending on the users’ choice. 

##  Tech: 

This app was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and deployed using MongoDB Atlas and Heroku. 

MongoDB - document database 

Express(.js) - Node.js web framework 

React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework 

Node(.js) - JavaScript web server


## Improvements for the future: 

Implement search functionality for users to efficiently find and locate NFT’s from their watchlist 

Implement user authentication - I.e. login credentials 

## What went well 

Implemented GitHub best practices when collaborating on projects - I.e., created branches specific to features and/or certain functionality. Tested each before merging to dev/ main branches and eventually deploying. 

Utilized Miro - project management tool to help prioritize daily sprint goals in order to complete MVP (minimum viable product). Once we were able to successfully finish MVP we used Miro to help us visualize stretch goals and our app design.
